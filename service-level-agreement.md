# Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Effective Date:** January 1st, 2025

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) is an integral part of the Syskit End
User License Agreement (EULA). By accepting the EULA, you are accepting
this SLA which forms an integral part of the EULA. This SLA determines
the targeted availability of hosting services that Syskit provides to
the customer as a "Software as a Service." If there is a conflict
between the terms of this SLA and the EULA regarding the hosting
services, the terms of the SLA will apply.

Syskit shall make hosting services available to the customer pursuant to
this SLA and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the
hosting services available at the gateway between the public internet
and the network of the Cloud Services Provider, except for:\
(i) scheduled Downtime; and\
(ii) as set forth in the EULA and this SLA.

Customer understands that the SLA does not constitute a warranty for the
customer.\
"**Downtime**" means a period of time during which the customer is
unable to use all aspects of the hosting services for which the customer
has permission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Uptime Commitment

Syskit warrants that the hosting service shall have an uptime of **not
less than 99.95%** in any Calendar Month.\
"**Calendar Month**" means each full month during the term of the
hosting service measured from 12:00 a.m. Central European Time on the
first day of the month through 11:59 p.m. Central European Time on the
last day of the month.

Customer shall bring forth any claim of excessive Downtime by submitting
the details of such Downtime to Syskit (by emailing
**support@syskit.com**). Customer must provide all reasonable details
regarding the event and the level of service the customer claims was not
met. Syskit must receive such claims **no later than the end of the
calendar month following** the month in which the alleged Downtime
occurred.

After Syskit's investigation of such claims, should Syskit determine
that it has not met the uptime requirement set forth herein, Customer
shall, as an exclusive remedy, be entitled to a **Service Credit** not
to exceed in any particular Calendar Month **10% of the monthly fees**
for the hosting services paid by the customer to Syskit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Service Credit Calculation

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Availability of Hosting Service (per        Service Credit (% of
  Calendar Month)                             monthly fee)
  ------------------------------------------- ---------------------------
  \< 99.95%                                   2%

  \< 97.00%                                   5%

  \< 95.00%                                   10%
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any Service Credits shall be credited to Customer within **30 days** of
the determination of excessive Downtime by Syskit as set out above.
Syskit will calculate a Service Credit based on the service charges that
were in effect in the month in which the guaranteed service level was
not achieved. Calculated Service Credit will be applied in the form of a
**credit or discount against a future invoice** for Syskit's service.

Syskit will not be liable for multiple Service Credits for the same
Calendar Month, i.e., the total Service Credits awarded with respect to
any Calendar Month shall not, under any circumstance, exceed **10% of
the monthly fees** for the hosting services paid by the customer to
Syskit.

Service credits represent the **sole obligation of Syskit** towards the
customer in the event of the guaranteed level of service not being
available. Therefore, the customer is not entitled to any other claims
from Syskit due to the lack of guaranteed availability of the hosting
service. If there are **unpaid invoices or other monetary obligations**
towards Syskit, the customer is **not entitled to Service Credits** in
accordance with the SLA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Additional Performance Targets

Syskit may, at its sole discretion, announce additional performance
targets for the hosting services and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to meet those targets. The Parties agree that the additional
performance targets may be amended by Syskit at any time and at its sole
discretion and that a failure of Syskit to meet those targets shall not
entitle Customer to a refund of any fees paid under the Agreement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exclusions

The above uptime and Downtime and any additional performance targets
shall not apply to the extent any performance or availability issues are
a result of:

1.  Scheduled Downtime for maintenance and updates to the hosting
    services (Syskit shall, to the extent practicable, schedule so as
    not to adversely affect customer's business), or\
2.  Factors outside Syskit's reasonable control, including but not
    limited to performance or availability issues that are:
    -   Caused by a fault or failure of the internet or any public
        telecommunications network;
    -   Caused by a fault or failure or availability problems of the
        Cloud Storage Provider;
    -   Caused by a fault or failure or availability problems of any
        cloud-based services registered by Customer in the Hosted
        Property;
    -   Caused by customer's hardware or software;
    -   Caused by the actions or inactions of the customer;
    -   Caused by the customer's use of hosting services; or
    -   Attributable to the acts or omissions of customer or customer's
        Authorized Users, or anyone gaining access to the hosting
        services by means of the customer's Accounts, passwords, or
        equipment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The SLA does not apply to the following:

-   Beta and evaluation hosting services\
-   Non-production environments, including but not limited to test,
    disaster recovery, quality assurance, or development\
-   Claims made by the customer's users, guests, participants, and
    permitted invitees

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Point User Licenses

The customer must purchase an equivalent number of **Syskit Point user
licenses** to the number of their active and licensed Microsoft 365
users.\
During the license period, Syskit shall allow no more than **10% of all
such users to be unlicensed**.\
The customer must adjust the total number of licensed users at the
contract renewal date.\
**Point Audit Logs** are retained for one year, unless the Customer
purchases an extension.
